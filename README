NAME
       Time::Beat - Module to convert between standard time and Swatch 
       ".beat" time.

DESCRIPTION
       "Time::Beat" is a module to convert normal time to and from .beats,
       of which there are a thousand in a day. It can change normal time in 
       time() format to .beats, and .beats into either 24-hour or 12-hour 
       normal time.

SYNOPSIS
           use Time::Beat qw(beat time24 time12);

           my $time_in_beats = beats($time);

           my $beats_in_24hr_time = time24($beat);

           my $beats_in_12hr_time = time12($beat);

METHODS
       There are three methods in Time::Beat.

       o beats($time)
           "beats" will give you the current time in .beats if you do not
           specify a time string. If you specify a string in "time()" 
           format it will return that particular time in .beats. The basic 
           algorithm for doing this is to take the time in GMT+1 hour, 
           convert it into seconds, and divide by 86.4.

       o time24($beat)
           "time24" takes a 3-digit beat time and outputs a 24-hour time
           along the lines of "12:34:56". The hours will have leading 
           noughts.

       o time12($beat)
           "time12" takes a 3-digit beat time and outputs a 12-hour time
           along the lines of "12:34:56 am" or "12:34:56 pm". Hours do not 
           have leading noughts.

CHANGES
       Important: As of v1.2 the method names have changed. The former
       method names, "beattime", "timebeat24" and "timebeat12" will still 
       work, but they have been deprecated, and will be removed at some 
       point in the future.

           This module by Iain Truskett <spoon@cpan.org> does much the same
           thing but in an OO fashion, and is part of the DateTime project; 
           if you need something more sophisticated, I would suggest you 
           look into that. My thanks also to Iain for contributing patches 
           to this module.
